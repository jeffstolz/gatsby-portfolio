            In early 2023, I was tasked with designing dashboard visualizations
            for HPE GreenLake, the company's flagship platform aimed at helping
            customers manage their on-premises IT infrastructure and resources.
            My research & explorations led to a strategic shift towards a
            broader personalization initiative, which transformed into a key
            strategy for the organization.

          <Description>
            Traditionally, the HPE GreenLake Platform was designed as a
            "one-size-fits-all" solution, primarily catering to administrators.
            However, a diverse array of users with different needs found the
            platform lacking an understanding of their needs, which led them to
            adopt third-party tools to manage their IT estate. This not only
            resulted in decreased revenue for the company but also eroded user
            confidence in the product.

                I introduced the strategy, gained executive buy-in, introduced

                through implementation, and continued to lead a team of
                designers as they iterated on this approach.

          <Description>
            This project began as a simple request: design some data
            visualizations that all users would find useful on the platform
            homepage. I began with a stakeholder workshop to identify
            opportunities to surface data on the platform, but we quickly
            learned that we were generalizing a solution-first approach. I
            reframed the task into a question: "what do users what to accomplish
            when they first enter the platform?" This gave us a proper starting
            point to explore the problem space.

                The team had collected a series of user personas that focused on

                fan of jobs to be done for their focus on behaviors and changing
                context, and worked with the team to explore these before
                arriving at our solution.

                roles & privileges, and resource types.

                Our discovery explorations forced us to change our thinking: as

                their specific problems. We needed to create solutions that
                would scale for a variety of use cases, both known and unknown.

            At HPE, designers have historically had little influence on the

            implementation. This posed a challenge getting this initiative,
            which had a demonstrable need & value, into the hands of end users.
            I needed to flip this narrative, and pitched a north star vision
            directly to the CTO. With executive buy-in, we had a path to our
            product roadmap.

            our global platform search through a pin search functionality.

            The platform would also recommend related services to users based on
            their related services & role (rather than a static list).

          <Description>
            The rise of AI/ML has opened the doors for deeper personalization in
            all software experiences, creating a huge opportunity for product
            designers to go beyond user configuration and proactively anticipate
            user needs. I dedicated some time, through course work &
            conferences, to better educate myself on the subject, and came back
            with recommendations on how we could leverage this technology for
            our GreenLake users.

                Our platform user needs are diverse, and it's difficult to

                simulate the "white glove" experience and act as a helpful
                companion along the user journey.

                The current platform experience relies on a lot of manual data

            Every project creates opportunities to learn and grow as a designer.
            This particular effort taught me a lot about design leadership and
            user advocacy. I also learned a great deal about the emerging field
            of AI/ML.

                This was the first time I presented to a senior executives at a
                Fortune 100 company. Similary to how we design software, it was
                important to tailor the message to the audience and understand
                their motivations.

                the complete picture of user activity and motivations.

                to principal designer.
